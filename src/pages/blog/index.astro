                This is a fun little side project I intend on updating every now
                and then when I encounter a fun problem/solution I want to share
            </p>
            <p>
                I intend on uploading the challenges I face and the solutions I
                come up with, as well as relevant code snippets in order to have
                more context
            </p>
